Hi David,

As per my previous email, I think we should try this again with some different versioning parameters. Note: versioning seems to be the "challenge of the day" doesn't it! ðŸ™‚

And yes - the first link has the Concept Maps that should (hopefully) be ready to test:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-08cA1m-CAy8humztO0S5Djr_wtXibmNn6w4_uFCIE/edit#gid=285304653

The second link has the complete set of Concept Maps (both ready for testing, plus draft and WIP ones)
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-08cA1m-CAy8humztO0S5Djr_wtXibmNn6w4_uFCIE/edit#gid=245875863

And then this sheet has the observable codes and dependency-property-tags that we need for the initial Rau Rau work:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-08cA1m-CAy8humztO0S5Djr_wtXibmNn6w4_uFCIE/edit#gid=1518541776

Note: The concept maps for Rau Rau are still not yet complete .... but hopefully there are enough there to start testing.
